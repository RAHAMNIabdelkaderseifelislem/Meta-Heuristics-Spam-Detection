# Meta Heuristics for spam detection

## Introduction

This project is a part of the course "Meta Heuristics" at the University of Applied Sciences in Amsterdam. The goal of this project is to create a spam filter using 2 different meta heuristics. The first meta heuristic is the Wolf pack optimization (WPO) algorithm and the second one is Shark smell optimization (SSO) algorithm. The goal of this project is to compare the performance of these two algorithms and to see which one is better for this problem.

as we know the spam detection is a binary classification problem, so we will use the accuracy as a metric to compare the performance of the two algorithms.
